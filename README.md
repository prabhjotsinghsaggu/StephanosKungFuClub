Stephanos Kungfu Club

➢	The Project has been made on Netbeans 8.1.
➢	The framework used is Spring 4.0.1 and Hibernate 4.3.x(JPA2.1)
➢	To access the database in Spring we have added MySQL JDBC Driver library.
➢	We first created the database and after that we mapped it using Spring ( using @ Annotations).
➢	In this project, we added or inserted the values manually (using MySQL (Insert)) in Meeting, Class, Fees, Rank and Parents in the backend. 
➢	We can add students through the frontend (using java Getter and Setter).
➢	To access the data on our webpages we have embedded MySQL code(Select) in our Java class files.

Usernames and Passwords

When you start running the Project, you will encounter a login page. You need the following login information:
➢	Username : chonzom or prabhjot
➢	Password : drish
We have included the admin information in a Members table for which values were inserted using MySQL (Insert).

JDBC Properties for database

➢	jdbc.driverClassName = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
➢	jdbc.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springhib
